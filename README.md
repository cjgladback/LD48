# LD48
 Setting up for Ludum Dare 48, a game jam for which I normally complete the 72 hr version. And unless I suddenly get my act together in the next two days and recover the knowledge I lost in a git issue right after last jam, this will be no exception.


TODO: (significantly started ~ vs better for on stream less focus ^)
- ~~Make tiny sample Ink story (to be sure we're assigning tags and sprites to the right things)~~
- Make tags affect panel color and text style
- Make story progress through rooms, to windows, picking up objects, etc. (effecting images on screen)
- Pile photos--increase count by singles until re-entering, increase count substantially for re-entry
- Take photos--cue animation (oh you sweet summer child) and sound along with piles and camera state changes
- Cue taking photos branch and results with a hotkey?
- Make room art (blender + paintover?) ^
- Make camera, polaroids, books, and notes art ^
- Make flash overlays art (with and without monsters) ^
- Write story
- Design sound ~
- Make ***menu*** for sound settings **and reminder of hotkey** ~


Art needed:
Backgrounds:
- Outside game
- Car interior (with volume knobs?)
- Car interior night
- Car exterior (maybe just for individual ends)
- Front of lighthouse
- Entryway
- Hall
- Hall window (more lit)
- Stairs
- Beacon rooms
- Photo piles

Endings:
- Crashing car
- Friend drowned? (Eek that's dark but seems like an acheivable, not-cheap bad end if you just deteriorate to the point of not doing anything all night and the monsters go back to displace water again)
- Say cheese (taking a pic of the monster in the light of the beacon)
- A little on the nose? (safely at the diner in town, having bopped the monster with an old dead tree, deathtrap "I guess that's why they needed her release form immediately" mentioned at the start of the game)

Props:
- Camera
- Camera printing photo
- Empty photo
- Populated photo
- Release form copy
- Books (Megafauna, Magnetic Marvels, Lost to History: The Mystery of the Un-Known (from the plainly ignored truth of Roanoke to the ghost towns of the Old West, a book about towns we know were settled and when they disappeared), and Lebec County Poetry Society's Heritage Anthology: Sharing the Folk Tunes, Tall Tales, and Bright Spirits of Our Forebearers (Lebec is maybe a real county in California, but more importantly it's a real dude who died hunting grizzlies in California according to Wikipedia))
- Research notes (there's extreme tide off the lake, affecting access to the caves, seemingly always higher during the day; she wonders if it could be magnetic pull distorting the water surface, is taking more readings to check her data before contacting experts in that area) (she's excited about unique crystal formations, seemingly impossible collections of gems growing together from the same seed crystals--and massive. she's frankly surprised they're still there, though they are mostly in the lowest pocket caves and would have only been exposed in the last five years with the rapid water decline)
