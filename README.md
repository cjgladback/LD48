# LD48
 Setting up for Ludum Dare 48, a game jam for which I normally complete the 72 hr version. And unless I suddenly get my act together in the next two days and recover the knowledge I lost in a git issue right after last jam, this will be no exception.


TODO:
- Make tiny sample Ink story (to be sure we're assigning tags and sprites to the right things)
- Make story progress through rooms, to windows, picking up objects, etc. (effecting images on screen)
- Pile photos--increase count by singles until re-entering, increase count substantially for re-entry
- Take photos--cue animation and sound along with piles and camera state changes
- Cue taking photos branch and results with a hotkey?
- Make menu for sound settings and reminder of hotkey
- Make room art (blender + paintover?)
- Make camera, polaroids, books, and notes art
- Make flash overlays art (with and without monsters)
- Write story
- Design sound
