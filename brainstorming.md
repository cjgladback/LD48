Deeper and deeper brainstorming

"I have reservations."
"As do we all, my dear boy. As do we all."
Checking into a hotel that's labrynthine and find out your room is deep in it. For reasons.
You reserved the room with blackout curtains; they didn't have any and so reserved a room with exclusively interior walls?
Retelling the story of the minotaur? You father sent you here (made the reservations himself, to aid with your sleeping?) to keep you out of the public eye during a scandal he's kicking off.
Unbeknownst to both of you, the hotel is alive and requires periodic feeding. It intends to feast on you, as well as the spring break trip of 14 coeds.
Also, you keep finding string laying down various hallways and wrapping around corners. Placed by an investigative journalist whose source is friends with the front desk clerk. (The clerk is Daedelus and the pap is Theseus.)



You've just arrived at your friend's residency; they're here living and studying the cliffs and caves in the area, writing a huge research paper they'll present at the end of the summer and showing people around the retired lighthouse on weekends in exchange for a stipend and room and board.
You were a couple hours later than you had discussed, and your phone died after your charger cable frayed. So you're not surprised they don't immediately open the door. But that all of the lights are off? It's not that late.
You get more and more paranoid while in the building; turns out the power is entirely down, so though you have moonlight from the windows your only clear light source is the polaroid camera.
The amount of polaroids on the floor in the room increase every time you use the camera in a room (the flash animation will be more difficult than changing polaroid images in view up close and on the ground; obviously, sound would be good to happen simultaneously).
When you re-enter a room, though, the polaroids are literally piled on the floor. Re-entering again, you'll find the piles deeper.
You find reference books and notes from your friend's research; you have to stand by the windows to read them, though you keep thinking you're seeing something out of the corner of your eye and don't want to stay by the window.
Eventually, you think you see something inside, too--you take a picture. And holy crap there is something there. (You can then take the picture to the window to check it, or drop it like usual.)
You have unlimited polaroids because it's not actually (probably trademarkered) a polaroid camera but a version that your friend? or you? has been tinkering with. Let's say you're good with gadgets and made it; brought it with for a vacation field test. Are fully aware it shouldn't be *that* unlimited when the shots are ankle deep.

Tags need to differentiate narration (Sarah's thoughts) versus what Sarah is saying (and of course what Kasey or anyone else says). We can edit variables for what's being held more easily. Though it will require referencing both "are we lit?" and "what are we holding?" to choose the appropriate sprite.

Start with an audio-settings screen that has story to it (need to set the story to move at a timed interval without visible buttons, or accept the lack of captions for this part, which I refuse to.)
The girls are talking on the phone, sharing jokes and saying they look forward to seeing each other. It's sunny outside.
Next scene, Sarah is exasperated at how late she is and that her phone died. "Hope Kasey has a charger or I'm driving back up to town tomorrow. So much for overpacking."
The lights are off, but she left the door unlocked for you (as she said it would be, granted you said you'd be there around sunset--not the best security choice, but appreciated nonetheless).
